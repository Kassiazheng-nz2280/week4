I dont know how to change different stroke, beacuse everytime i change one part, everthing change together, thats not what i want.

By putting different sketch.js and index.html files in directories we can more easily switch between multiple experiments.

I finally draw the tail, it is made by 2 circle layed over each other.
And I leanred push and pop, it's a very good tool.

There is many fun part about this assigment, I leanred many stuff. It's very statisfied to look at the final result that my dog can move.

For SKetch 1, it is hw HW04B, I try to deisgn a heart. That one I clicked it can change random color and size. I found out that it's hard to create a heart shape.
